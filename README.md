## The Mission

STEMentor’s mission is to provide access to the world of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) careers to ALL students through curated educational and informative content and real-time connections to STEM professionals.

## The App

The STEMentor web app acts as a bridge between STEM professionals and students interested in STEM careers. Our mentors are recruited from top technology companies and universities, and are willingly volunteering to offer their advice and counsel to students seeking to better understand STEM career opportunities.

Mentors can create profiles on the site, and provide relevant information about themselves such as their name, current job, college degree, and languages spoken. Students can then search our database of mentors based on criteria that is important to them.

Once a student finds a mentor, they are able to send questions to that mentor. Both the mentors and the students have inboxes where they can see messages received, and respond to them.
